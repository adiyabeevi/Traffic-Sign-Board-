# Traffic Sign Classification 
A deep learning project that classifies traffic signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
This model can recognize multiple types of signs and is suitable for use in driver-assistance systems, road-safety applications, and prototype autonomous systems.

##  Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign
The project uses a labelled traffic-sign dataset (e.g., German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark – GTSRB or similar).  
Ensure your dataset is structured as:

dataset/
├── Train/
└── Test/


Each class folder should contain its respective images.
